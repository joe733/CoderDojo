# CoderDojo

> CoderDojo is a global volunteer-led community of free programming workshops for young people between 7 and 17. The movement is a grassroots organisation with individual clubs acting independently. A charity called the CoderDojo Foundation operates out of Dublin and supports the various clubs by providing a central website and some other support services.

This repository `logs` my activities as part of CoderDojo program.
